  Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), and
  CoSMIC(TM)
  
   [1]ACE(TM), [2]TAO(TM), [3]CIAO(TM), and [4]CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth
   referred to as "DOC software") are copyrighted by [5]Douglas C.
   Schmidt and his [6]research group at [7]Washington University,
   [8]University of California, Irvine, and [9]Vanderbilt University,
   Copyright (c) 1993-2005, all rights reserved. Since DOC software is
   open-source, freely available software, you are free to use, modify,
   copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software
   source code and object code produced from the source, as well as copy
   and distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however,
   include this copyright statement along with code built using DOC
   software.
   
   You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases
   and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code
   that is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not do
   anything to the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or
   claiming authorship of the DOC software code, that will prevent DOC
   software from being distributed freely using an open-source
   development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC
   software in your software, though we encourage you to let [10]us know
   so we can promote your project in the [11]DOC software success
   stories.
   
   The [12]ACE, [13]TAO, [14]CIAO, and [15]CoSMIC web sites are
   maintained by the [16]DOC Group at the [17]Institute for Software
   Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the [18]Center for Distributed Object
   Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development of
   open-source software as part of the open-source software community. By
   submitting comments, suggestions, code, code snippets, techniques
   (including that of usage) and algorithms (collectively
   ``Submissions''), submitters acknowledge that they have the right to
   do so, that any such Submissions are given freely and unreservedly,
   and that they waive any claims to copyright or ownership. In addition,
   submitters acknowledge that any such Submission might become part of
   the copyright maintained on the overall body of code that comprises
   the DOC software. By making a Submission, submitter agree to these
   terms. Moreover, submitters acknowledge that the incorporation or
   modification of such Submissions is entirely at the discretion of the
   moderators of the open-source DOC software projects or their
   designees.
   
   Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties
   whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement
   of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular
   purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,
   indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages,
   including without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the
   possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is
   with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design,
   merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose,
   noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade
   practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
   their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to
   the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
   software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington
   University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or
   students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special,
   indirect and consequential damages.
   
   DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on
   the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
   their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction,
   modification, or enhancement. A [19]number of companies around the
   world provide commercial support for DOC software, however.
   
   DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform
   is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US
   daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of
   2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for
   the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software
   obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems
   users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they
   upgrade their operating systems accordingly.
   
   The names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), CoSMIC(TM), Washington
   University, UC Irvine, and Vanderbilt University, may not be used to
   endorse or promote products or services derived from this source
   without express written permission from Washington University, UC
   Irvine, or Vanderbilt University. Further, products or services
   derived from this source may not be called ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM),
   or CoSMIC(TM) nor may the name Washington University, UC Irvine, or
   Vanderbilt University appear in their names, without express written
   permission from Washington University, UC Irvine, and Vanderbilt
   University.
   
   If you have any suggestions, additions, comments, or questions, please
   let [20]me know.

  LICENSE ISSUES
  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
